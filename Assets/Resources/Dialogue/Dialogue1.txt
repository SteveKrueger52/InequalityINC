player;Hi Dave. Could I ask you a few questions?;neutral;R
dave;Um… Sure. What’s up, Player?;neutral;L
player;I’ve received several complaints from female employees who feel sexually discriminated against by some male employees;neutral;R
player;Have you noticed any interactions that might support these claims?;neutral;R
dave;Hm… Well, now that you mention it, I notice that Stan doesn’t really seem to listen when Sharon and Janet speak up in our weekly team meetings.;sad;L
dave;In fact, I don’t think I can recall him ever actually rolling with any of their ideas. He usually just dismisses them. Is that helpful?;neutral;L
options;Very helpful! Thanks, Dave.:8;Yes, very helpful… But is there anything else you can tell me?:10:L:dave,4:dave,+
dave;Glad I could help.;happy;L
end;+;
dave;Yeah… I also remember that once Stan actually told Sharon that her idea was dumb and that he couldn’t believe she still had a position at this company;neutral;L
dave;especially considering how, and I quote, “emotional she always is.”;neutral;L
dave;I remember Sharon started tearing up and had to leave the meeting early. That was a rough day.;sad;L
player;Thanks, Dave. You’ve been a real help.;happy;R
